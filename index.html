      <h2>The Unsettling Talents of Cockroaches</h2>
      <p>
Cockroaches are small, determined, and far too comfortable in places they were not invited. They move silently through the shadows, always appearing at the exact wrong time.
There is one ability they seem particularly proud of: they can ........ without warning, and it genuinely unsettles me.
Even more concerning is their second talent. A cockroach can ........ in complete darkness as if it has rehearsed the layout of your house in advance.
While some people admire their resilience, I would prefer they demonstrate their impressive skills somewhere that is not my kitchen.
